## Vision

To build a reusable, modular UI system that improves:

- Maintainability
- Performance
- Design consistency
- Scalability across large Framer projects

---

## Architecture Goals

- Component isolation
- Predictable layout systems
- Clean animation logic
- Minimal overrides
- Reusable design tokens

---

## Status

Early-stage development.
Core components currently under active design.

## Architecture Proposal

Detailed repository analysis and a scalable folder structure proposal are available in `docs/ui-system-structure-proposal.md`.
